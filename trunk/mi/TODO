DONE - Add an environment variable which controls the output log file name
DONE - Add printing stack facility
DONE - Add an environment variable which controls whether to print or not the stack
DONE - Make it working for C code
DONE - Decide what to do with libpthread.so - should be looked for by the ldd output
DONE - write a script which wrappers the LD_PRELOAD and the actual call
DONE - write an analysis script
DONE - Add headers with a license
DONE - Add README file
DONE - Add Changelog file
DONE - Check indirect linking with libpthread.so i.e. script which runs an elf which
       is linked to pthread
- Think of better stack printing
DONE - Add mi command line arguments to control log file name and backtrace printing
DONE - statmi return code: non-zero if there are warnings or mistakes
DONE - Make sure that the error output goes into stderr
DONE - make sure that the traceback is printed in the same order as mutex lock stack
DONE - collected chains printout does not look properly in case of backtrace and -v
       The operations must be printed in reverse order
DONE - add limit to the number of errors
DONE - threads and mutexes legend is not alphabetically sorted

DONE - Add to the doc that loading pthread via dlopen() will not catch the calls
DONE - Add executable name to the log file
DONE - Is the printout good for the improper lock order? - No
DONE - Locking in one thread and unlocking in another
DONE - symbolic links for the app!

- Test cases:
    DONE - OK in elf (test-ok-elf.cpp)
    DONE - OK in so (test-lib-fun-ok.cpp and test-ok-lib.cpp)
    DONE - left locked in elf (test-bad-left-locked-elf.cpp)
    DONE - unlocking not locked in elf (test-bad-unlocking-not-locked-elf.cpp)
    DONE - improper unlocking order in elf (test-bad-unlock-order-elf.cpp)
    DONE - improper locking order in elf (test-bad-lock-order-elf.cpp)
    DONE - improper locking order in so (test-lib-fun-bad.cpp and test-bad-lib.cpp)
    DONE - failed operations (test-failed-op.cpp)
    DONE - time consuming operations (tested on manually modified log file)
    DONE - recursive mutexes OK in elf (test-ok-recursive-elf.cpp)
    DONE - improper locking order in daemon (daemon-test-bad-lock-order-elf.sh)
    DONE - condition variables 
    DONE - locking in one thread and unlocking in another
