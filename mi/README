pthread Mutex Instrumentation

There are 2 steps:
1. Run your application via the provided script:
   ./mi.py yourProgram
   Type:
   ./mi.py --help
   for a usage message
   You also have an option to set the environment variables described below
   manually as well as LD_PRELOAD=<path to libmi.so> and run your
   application directly.
2. As soon as the application finished run another script:
   ./statmi.py
   Type:
   ./statmi.py --help
   for a usage message


Environment variables considered by libmi.so:
MI_LIBPTHREAD - path to the system pthread library. If the variable is not set
                then mi will look for the path to the library using ldd on the
                given program to be analysed
MI_LOGFILE    - path to the log file where the collected information is stored
MI_OPTIONS    - accepted values:
                stack - accompany each operation with a stack trace (slow)
