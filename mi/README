pthread Mutex Instrumentation

Environment variables:
MI_LIBPTHREAD - path to the system pthread library. If the variable is not set
                then mi will look for the path to the library using ldd on the
                given program to be analysed
MI_LOGFILE    - path to the log file where the collected information is stored
MI_OPTIONS    - accepted values:
                stack - accompany each operation with a stack trace (slow)

There are 3 steps:
1. Set the required environment variables. You may not set any. In this case
   the default log file will be mi.log, libpthread.so will be searched in
   the list of dinamically linked libraries of the given binary and the stack
   trace will no be collected.
2. Run your application via the provided script:
   ./mi yourProgram
   Type:
   ./mi --help
   for a usage message
   You also have an option to set the described environment variables manually
   as well as LD_PRELOAD=<path to libpthread.so> and run your application
   directly.
3. As soon as the application finished run another script:
   ./statmi
   Type:
   ./statmi --help
   for a usage message
