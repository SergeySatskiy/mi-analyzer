Prerequisites:
- python 2.5.2 or 2.6 (http://www.python.org)
- if you do not set MI_LIBPTHREAD variable manually then ldd must be available
  via PATH and the application given to mi must be an ELF file

mi does not require any special installation. Just copy all the mi files
to the location you want to keep them. You might want to adjust the PATH
variable correspondingly.

see README for running instructions
